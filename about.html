				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="splitimage">
					<div><img src="self.jpg"></div>
					<div><p id="biotext">I am an artist and hobbist living in Vancouver, Washington. I spend my time picking up new hobbies and projects to try out. Each skill I learn feeds into each new project I pick up. I haved used my painting knowledge on my woodworking projects, and my pottery knowledge on my computer building projects.<br><br>It is hard to feel fulfilled if I am not able to work on the big idea in my head. These incessant ideas lead to many different hobbies and skillsets. I like to garden, keep aquarium fish, play video games, and draw. If I am not doing one of these things, I am probably thinking of something new to try.<br><br>Currently, I am a video editor and designer for Fisher Investments. I have settled myself in my current position because of the unique creativity and independence it offers. Lots of my time at work is spent trying to keep up with several ongoing projects while planning for the next big one. This fast paced environment where creativity and improvement are encouraged makes me excited to go to work each day. </p></div>

						<h3>What I Bring</h3>
						<hr>
						<p>I am extremely enthusiastic about learning and experimenting. I am always ready to just go for a project and learn with my errors. I am always ready to work with others, often learning things from them in the process. My constant experimentation gives me experience in a huge amount of fields, giving me a chance to help with projects of any sort. My knowledge of computers can inspire my artworks and vice versa. This allows me to have a unique point-of-view in any team. I can think like a designer, a painter, a programmer, and editor, etc whenever the project requires it. All of my works benefit from the moment where I step back and shift my thinking to how someone else would feel. 
						</p>

						<h3>What I Want</h3>
						<hr>
						<p>I want projects that challenge me to learn the ins and outs of the tools/software in question. When the uniqueness and heart of a project keeps me driven to work on it, I know that I have chosen a great project. Throughout my career, I have always valued feedback and a growth mindset. Any setting that will allow me to continue learning is a great fit for me. I find that my continued learning is assisted with constant creativity. Projects that allow me to put my own spin on things are the most engaging for me.

				<h1>How I Got Here</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Our values and interests can determine our choices throughout our life and influence our entire careers. I feel that I have gotten to a steady part of my life that I enjoy where I can experience something new every day, but still have time to relax with those who are important to me. My comfortable situation has led me to reflect on how my personality and interests have gotten me to this point in my life. I believe that one of the most life changing decisions that you can make is to learn what you value and stick to each and every one. 
					<br><br>
					Though each value has a great effect on where we end up in our lives, I find that my passion for learning has both given me the most encouragement to take up opportunities, as well as given me the most reluctance to take up others; This baseline value of mine has kept me on the right path. In situations where I see a great opportunity to grow and spend my time learning, I can jump on them with speed but in situations where I notice that my time is being wasted by a stagnant atmosphere, I can look for the nearest opportunites for growth. 
					<br><br>
					Attempting to find a time and place for my interests has led me to great opportunites through life. Even through my high school years, I used the opportunity that I was given of free housing with family (I am extremely grateful of this privilege) to wait for the best job openings. I felt that if I were to get a job as soon as possible, I would feel stuck with whatever I got. My waiting led me to a position in an art gallery that allowed me to network with local students and artists with similar interests. Outisde of my work life, always having a passion project to work on has been a constant reason to learn new skills. Each interest I have allowed in my life leads to more skills I can aquire.
					<br><br>
					Our values and interests lead us to these moment in our lives that determines the outcome of our entire futures. Some moments in my own life that stick out to me are: when I decided to change my major from Biology to Digital Technology and Culutre, when I conducted an interview with someone in a position I saught and asked them for their help, and when I decided to move to somewhere I could feel more creative.<br><br>

				<h1>The Importance of Interviewing</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>I got my position at Fisher Investments by initiating an informational interview with a senior multimedia producer. To continue my learning and stay in close contact, I scheduled a second informational interview after I got the position. I wanted to stay informed on the company, the job market, and what it is like to work in our team. Our interview was enlightening. My interviewee (who is also my mentor) had a good experience alongside me by allowing him to take some time to think about the questions for himself. He told me that the questions that most helped him were about how he got here and where he is going. His honesty about his own lack of reflection helped me realise how important self reflection can be for your career and throughout your life. If even a seasoned professional can be helped with a period of reflection, then it must be very important for those who are just beginning their careers. I noticed that both he and I were more focused on our goals after our conversation. <br><br>
The fact that both of us work in similar positions made his answers much easier to relate to myself. He told me that the most important thing in our line of work is the growth mindset. Everyone needs to be able to work on themselves in our line of work. Each day is an opportunity to learn and develop our skills. He had quite a few anecdotes about how Fisher Investments managers were there to help him try new things and work on his content. It was reassuring to hear that growth would be supported at our company, but it was, more importantly, helpful to hear that my focus should not be on perfection, but continued trials. <br><br>
Even though I work at the same company as my mentor, I wanted to get a better view at the position and job market as a whole. He was an exceptionally helpful insight into the current state of multimedia production. It is helpful that I am in such an art inspired area (near Portland, Oregon), but experience will always trump education in our field. I was told that it is very hard to get any position in design or multimedia production right out of college. He stressed the importance of a good portfolio and previous works. I feel very lucky to have had an opportunity to work at Fisher Investments in the content department. It gives me the experience and practice that I need to succeed, regardless of where I decide to go in the future.
